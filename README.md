**Title:** Alternative GPT with Gemini API and Offline Capabilities

**Introduction:**

This project offers a cost-effective alternative to GPT by leveraging the Gemini API for online interactions and a locally trained model for offline scenarios. It aims to provide a robust chatbot with a 0% fail rate, ensuring continuous responses regardless of internet connectivity.

**Key Features:**

* **Cost-Effective Alternative:** Utilizes the free tier of the Gemini API for online interactions, reducing costs compared to traditional GPT solutions.
* **Dual Response Strategy:** Employs a combination of online and offline models to guarantee a response even without an internet connection.
* **Zero Fail Rate:** Ensures the chatbot can always respond to user queries, maintaining a seamless interaction experience.
* **Self-Learning (WIP):** This feature is under development and aims to enable the model to learn and improve through user interactions, similar to how we teach children.
* **Learning from Uploads (Work in Progress):** Future enhancements will allow the model to learn from uploaded datasets, expanding its knowledge base and improving its responses.

**Technical Overview:**

This section will be added once you provide more details about the implementation.  Here are some potential areas to cover:

* Programming language and libraries used
* Architecture of the online and offline models
* Details about the self-learning and upload learning functionalities (when implemented)

**Installation:**

(Provide instructions on how to install any required dependencies or packages)

**Usage:**

(Describe how to run the chatbot and interact with it, including any command-line arguments or configuration options)

**Current Limitations:**

* **Self-Learning and Upload Learning (WIP):** These features are currently under development and may have limited functionality.
* **Accuracy and Fluency:** As a young project, the model's responses may not always be perfectly accurate or fluent. We are actively working on improving its performance.

**Future Work:**

* **Refine Self-Learning:** Enhance the ability of the model to learn from user interactions.
* **Develop Upload Learning:** Implement functionality for the model to learn from uploaded data.
* **Improve Accuracy and Fluency:** Continuously improve the model's ability to generate reliable, informative, and engaging responses.
* **Expand Online Capabilities:** Explore advanced use cases with the Gemini API.
